## Explanation

So, I had everything inside the website. Which includes: Input & forms, feedback & status, layout & structure, data presentation. The one I dont' have is navigation. So I made navigation using breadcrumbs. 


# PART B: 
## Navigation

I have yet to have navigation. I will add breadcrumbs. This is because in the former design, we were not able to go back to the products page no matter what and it creates issues such as people who might want to add something or people who want to remove something from their cart. Also, it creates lots of confusion to the users. Users can only be sent back by going back to the previous page.

## Input & Output

I have a form in my payment page which asks for name, email, and phone number so that the client can contact the user themselves. This form has labels on top of each text form, and placeholders in the form, which can make the user understand what to put inside those labels and placeholders. Additionally, when you haven't put an @ in to the email part of the form, it refuses to submit the form, which means the user must input everything from above.

## Feedback & Status

When the user confirm payment, the button will turn into processing. Once that happens, the website is trying to process the data into the Google Sheets that is connected to the website. After that, the website will alert the user that their data has successfully been saved into the Google Sheets. If it has not, it will alert an error.

## Layout & Structure

The entire layout is in card view which is similar to the "lookbook" theme that our client wanted. The card view involves containers that have sometimes sharp or soft rounded edges. This will make the users gain the first impression that the theme feels comforting and professional.

## Data Presentation

I have already impremented the data presentation by presenting the website in devices like desktop, laptop, tablet, and phones. This makes the website accessable in every device. For example, on your phone, you can access this website easily and use every button.
