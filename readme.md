## Explanation

So, I had everything inside the website. Which includes: Input & forms, feedback & status, layout & structure, data presentation. The one I dont' have is navigation. So I made navigation using breadcrumbs. 


# PART B: 
## Navigation

I have yet to have navigation. I will add breadcrumbs. This is because in the former design, we were not able to go back to the products page no matter what and it creates issues such as people who might want to add something or people who want to remove something from their cart.

## Input & Output

I have a form in my payment page. This form has labels and placeholders which can make the user understand what to put inside those labels and placeholders.

## Feedback & Status

When the user confirm payment, it will show a text saying it succeeded.

## Layout & Structure

The entire layout is in card view which is similar to the "lookbook" theme that our client wanted.

## Data Presentation

I have already impremented the data presentation by presenting the website in devices like desktop, laptop, tablet, and phones. This makes it accessable in every device.
