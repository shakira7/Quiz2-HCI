## Explanation

So, I had everything inside the website. Which includes: Input & forms, feedback & status, layout & structure, data presentation. The one I dont' have is navigation. So I made navigation using breadcrumbs. 


# PART B: 

Navigation: I have yet to have navigation. I will add breadcrumbs. 
Input& Forms: Labels & Placeholders
Feedback & Status: System status: when the user confirm payment, it will show a text saying it succeeded. 
Layout & Structure: card view
Data Presentation: I have already impremented the data presentation by presenting the website in devices like desktop, laptop, tablet, and phones.
